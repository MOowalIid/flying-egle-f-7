            <strong>
                Sizing Tips:

            </strong>

            These skates are true to size. Zero break-ins are required. If the skates do not come in half sizes or doubt
            your true size, then round your size up.
            Generally, choose the size of your own skates according to the number of sports shoes. <b> If your instep is
                relatively high or your feet are relatively wide, it is recommended that you choose a larger size of
                skates</b>

            Flying Eagle F7 Optimum skates are the world’s most advanced, combining two plastics of two different
            densities to allow for perfect support and fit. New for 2020 is with the black and red shell! A soft v-cut
            cuff section as well as a soft lace hole area, designed to keep the skate close to your feet and at the same
            time excellent for jumps and slides thanks to your ankle being supported side to side yet free to move in a
            forward and backward motion. This is also great for long-distance skating as it allows you to bend your
            knees forward more than usual. This skate is extremely durable and versatile, built to last, and to satisfy
            even a very demanding and aggressive skater.
